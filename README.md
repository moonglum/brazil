**This is a spike to see how the DSL should look like.**

Brazil is an experimental Ruby DSL for creating queries for the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.org) in the the [Arango Query Language](https://www.arangodb.org/manuals/2/Aql.html). Brazil is also the fifth biggest producer of Avocados (according to Wikipedia) and an amazing movie. As chance would have it, the spike of this gem was done on my way to Brazil. Brazil is not intended to be a Object Document Mapper, but to be used by the ODM to build the queries. The DSL is inspired by both the Sequel and the ActiveRecord gems.

## ArangoDB

[ArangoDB](http://www.arangodb.org) is...

> [...] a distributed open-source database with a flexible data model for documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a convenient sql-like query language or JavaScript extensions.
