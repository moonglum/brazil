# Brazil

Brazil is an experimental Ruby DSL for creating queries for the [AvocadoDB](https://github.com/triAGENS/AvocadoDB) in AQL (The Avocado Query Language). Brazil is also the fifth biggest producer of Avocados (according to Wikipedia) and an amazing movie.

## AvocadoDB

AvocadoDB is...

> [...] a document-store, which focuses on durability of the data taking advantage of new technologies like SSD, support for graph and geo algorithms needed in social networks, ease of use for the developer and minimal effort to operate for the administrator.

## Avocado Query Language (AQL)

**Important Disclaimer: The AQL is still in development. Every part can change at any time.**

According to the [Avocado Wiki](https://github.com/triAGENS/AvocadoDB/wiki/AQL):

> The purpose of AQL is somewhat similar to SQL, but the language has notable differences to SQL. This means that AQL queries cannot be run in an SQL database and vice versa.

An AQL query looks like that (optional parts are wrapped in square brackets):

    SELECT select_statement
    FROM from_statement [join_statements]
    [WHERE where_statement]
    [ORDER BY order_by_statement]
    [LIMIT limit_statement]
    [WITHIN within_statement]
    [NEAR near_statement]

An query like that is represented by an `Brazil::Query` in Brazil. Every query has to have exactly one `from_statement` â€“ the `select_statement` defaults to returning everything:

```ruby
    query = Brazil::Query.new 
    query.from "collection c"
    puts query.evaluate #=> "SELECT c FROM collection c"
```

### where

The `WHERE` clause in AQL can be specified to restrict the result to documents that match certain criteria. In Brazil the statement is (currently) copied unmodified and not checked:

```ruby
    query = Brazil::Query.new 
    query.from "collection c"
	query.where "c.age < 40 && c.name == 'john'"
    puts query.evaluate #=> "SELECT c FROM collection c WHERE c.age < 40 && c.name == 'john'"
```

If multiple where clauses are provided, they will be connected with the and operator.
