**This is a spike to see how the DSL should look like.**

Brazil is an experimental Ruby DSL for creating queries for the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.org) in the the [Arango Query Language](https://www.arangodb.org/manuals/2/Aql.html). Brazil is also the fifth biggest producer of Avocados (according to Wikipedia) and an amazing movie. As chance would have it, the spike of this gem was done on my way to Brazil. Brazil is not intended to be a Object Document Mapper, but to be used by the ODM to build the queries. The DSL is inspired by both the Sequel and the ActiveRecord gems.

## ArangoDB

[ArangoDB](http://www.arangodb.org) is...

> [...] a distributed open-source database with a flexible data model for documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a convenient sql-like query language or JavaScript extensions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brazil'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install brazil
```

## Usage

In our examples we will use a collection of characters and their cast from the movie 'Brazil'. We will work our way through AQL using Brazil to generate the queries.

## The basic form

When you're querying using Brazil each of the queries needs at least two things: One or more `for_all` calls and exactly one `return_as` call. You can imagine that a query always iterates over each of the documents in a collection (there are of course indexes etc. that allow a lot of shortcuts, but for a basic mental model you can imagine it like this). For all the documents you selected, you have to specify what exactly you want to return. In the simplest case this is the entire document.

* `for_all('variable_name', in_collection: 'collection_name')`: Iterate over all documents in the collection with the name `collection_name` â€“ in each iteration call the current document `variable_name`.
* `return_as`: In its basic form it takes the name of a variable as a String. This will return the entire document denoted by the variable.

If, for example, you want to iterate over all characters in the `characters` collection and return each one of them, you could do that as follows:

```ruby
query = Query.for_all('character', in_collection: 'characters').return_as('character')
```
